# Stormwater SESYNC Pursuit

FIXME: need to describe project at high-level

## Structure of repo

### references/

Directory with references and / or links to references.

### notebooks/

Directory of Jupyter notebooks we are developing.

### data/

Directory for project data

## Coding protocol

For any and all bugs or code that needs to be changed add the following:

```
    FIXME: <add description of what needs to be changed or what is not working> 
```

## Proposal

Project proposal and outlines.

FIXME: should we add just the final proposal or have a directory **(i.e. a folder)** that is called *proposal/* and contains all of these files?
